# Gillie replies "Gillie!"
# Toyotomi says "what kind of stupid name is Gillie?"
# Gillie replies "My actual name is ?? 'Gillie' Gilligan and its not a stupid name."
# Toyotomi says "What was that boy?"
# Gillie replies "You hea...."
# Captain Thompson quickly cuts Gillie off and says "Forgive the sargent he seems to have lost himself, =>
 That is just what we call him your Mikado, Sorry about him he is just a young and impulsive lad, and still needs to learn his place."
# Toyotomi says "Captain Thompson you are a good man, and a man of respect also"
# Captain Thompson "You are to kind Mikado Toyotomi, thank you very much tho."
# Toyotomi asks "Would you men like some tea?"
# Captain Thompson replies "That would be splended, thank you"
# Toyotomi orders a maid to go get some chamomile tea
# Captain Thompson and Toyotomi start talking about the fight that happened earlier during the week and ask =>
 Gillie to leave the room as Toyotomi was expecting the Luietenant.
# Gillie can hear what is being said from outside but also does a small bit of lookinng the house:
    # from what Gillie can see the house seems to be in somewhat of ruin and distay.
# Toyotomi says "Captain Thompson why are you men causing so much trouble for me and my men"
# Captain Thompson replies "I am trying my best sir but you know how things are these men are made to fight"
# Toyotomi says "If they were any good at fighting they would have died with honor in battle!"
# Captain Thompson replies "Well if your guys werent hiding and fighting without honor, And actually fighting =>
    # us face on we wouldnt be having this talk"
# Toyotomi says "Well from now if your men want to die with honor we will start shooting them if they are out of line and will suffer more than wipping's"
# Gillie can now only hear muffled voices from now being down the hall.
    # He enters a room and it can have a different outcome for later on(Hitbox by window). 
# He then trys to enter another room that he can hear radio chatter coming from but he spots the maid returning with the tea.
# The door is open and Gillie hears the maid speak to Toyotomi => The Maid says to Toyotomi "Emperor my apologise but no more Gunpowder tea, I make chamomile your majesty."
# Toyotomi in a blind rage from being called dishonorable takes out a gun and points it at the maid
# The Maid looks up in horror and hands to face
# And kills the maid where she stands.
# *Cpt.Thompson steps back in shock and horror
# Gillie runs in and sees the maids body lying on the floor
# Cpt.Thompson says out of shock "have you gone bloody mad man!"
# Toyotomi replies to Cpt.Thompson "Man? "*aims gun at Cpt.Thompson's head without saying a word*.
# And tells Gillie and Captain Thompson to remove the body.
# While Gillie and Cpt.Thompson are picking up the body Toyotomi says "Its hard to find good workers"
# Gillie and Cpt. Thompson carry the maid downstairs to where the guards take her body from there.
# Gillie and Captain make there way back to camp
# walk back to camp:
    # pond in graden surrounded by bonzi trees(japaneses graden), 
    # steps down  to the Backyard are made from cut stone and see Guards are similar to pow's daily ins and outs
    # and steps back down are nearly not there any more with it varying from humps to steps (overgrown & hard to climb).
# Gillie says to Cpt. Thompson "I think I may have found a way in to the house sir".
# Cpt.Thompson replies "Oh good on you we might be able to use that later on if need be."
# Captain tells Gillie to go into the village to get some medical supplies for Lt Meehan.
# Gillie is also told by Cpt.Thompson" to go and talk with Tanaka and dont make it so obvious".
# Gillie replies "Why?"
# Cpt.Thompson says "Just do it sargent!"
# *change of body language*
# Gillie meets with Tanaka by the bridge/river/stream/bathing area
# Gillie has to find Tanaka.
# (this has to be done discreetly)
# Gillie is told by Tanaka that there is someone he has to meet in the village at a certain time (after sun down) and is given a phrase to say ??
# Sees lover/friend at the area he is to meet his Contact and hesitates to approach
# Gillie says "Niko ?" in a confused way.
# Niko turns and says "Hello Carl"
# Gillie says "Is everything alright ? What are..."
# Niko interjects "The birds will be flying high tomorrow"
# Gillie replies "What? Are you a Birdwatcher"
# Gillie follows up with "what are you... why are you..."
# Niko says "its ok Carl"
# Niko*takes his hand* places a map and a letter of instructions in Gillies hand.
# Niko says "Can only be now"
# Gillie replies "What?, I have to do this now ?"
# Niko replies "Yes Gillie only now, must do now, later no good"
# Niko hugs Gillie and says "I love you Carl"
# Gillie watches her leave.
# Gillie reads letter and looks at map.
# Gillie then leaves for the military camp that is further south of the village to and scope out the area 
# but needs to sabotage some of the AA(Anti-Air guns) as there is a friendly air raid the following night, 
    # and must also aquire some hanguns.
# Gillie gets to the camp and does what he needs to do
# While Gillie is on the way back from the military camp he runs into a patrol of that is heading in the direction of the camp and delays him.
# He must wait for them to pass or he will be caught and possibly killed.
# when he gets back to the there is a ship in the dock the area is light up with a flare/lights from ship.
# he must now sneak down to the doctors to sneak/break in and get some medicine for Lt.Meehan.
# Must get back before head count at 10pm
# He gets back with the tablets and gives them to DuPont to threat Lt.Meehan.
# Gillie asks DuPont "Do you think we got him the medicine in time?"
# DuPont replies and says "Hopefully but only time will tell."
# DuPont asks "where did you get the meds ?"
# Gillie replies "I got them off one of the soldiers i gave him some cigs for it"
# DuPont says "If we had known they had it we could have got the meds into him a fews days earlier and he would really stand a chance"
# Gillie replies "I know but the guy was holding out on me and he also made me do some extra work for it so thats why it took so long"
# Cpt.Thompson walks in and asks "did you get the meds ?"
# Gillie replies "Yes sir, DuPont here has given the Lt the meds already"
# Cpt.Thompson says "Good stuff sarge"
# Gillie replies "I need to talk to you about something in private Cap'n"
# Cpt.Thompson says "It can wait for the Morning, i think you should get some rest"
# Gillie protests but the Cpt isnt having any of it so Gillie returns to his quarters and falls alseep thinking about Niko and what happened tonight
# *the next Morning* Gillie is wolken by Cpt.Thompson.
# Gillie asks "Is everything alright Sir, do you need me to head out again ?"
# Cpt.Thompson replies "The Luietenant didnt make it Carl, i thought youd rather hear it from me than the other men as i know ye were i the field alot together."
# Ending for Chapter 2 is that the Luietenant dies.
